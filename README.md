# sc-step-up

This is a site for Sams Club built using Node.js framework Express.
Also due to client requirements for site to live on their own hosting, we used webpack to export files to static files.

***

To run project locally:

$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run dev

The site should now be visible on localhost:8080
